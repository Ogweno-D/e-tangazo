# Frontend

In our implementation of this frontend we will have a landing page and a form section where the user enters the name, number and message he or she wishes to be advertised.

## Backend

We will be using mysql with XAMMP, and the most important columns for this db will be userid(autogenerated), name, phone number and message.
